hi just made this bc i want smth to reference while making this project.

third party api calls 

third party calls + saving in db flow (COMPLETE_FLOW.md):
1. start call in respective .tsx file
2. go to that route under app/api
3. go to corresponding file under src/lib/services to actually call external api
4. get the result, and use src/lib/db to save it to db
5. propogate back
